# tccSPDM
Repository for the implementation of the SPDM protocol in the Linux Kernel

The group is using libspdm, QEMU and buildroot as tools to create an adapted version of the e1000 driver which is SPDM compatible, while also creating and adapted version of the e1000 device on QEMU and using both to simulate and test the protocol in a controlled environment. 

SPDM Specification can be found at: https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0274_1.1.0c.pdf
